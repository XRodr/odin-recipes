Before Project:

With this project I will see if I can do the basics things I learn of HTML from The Odin Project. Util now all I have learn is the boilerplate, headings, paragraphs, links, images and 2 versions of lists. I think; I don't remember anything more from the top of my head.
BTW english is not my first language, I'm saying this just in case.
